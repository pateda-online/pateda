Tinkering has always been a passion of mine. Sometimes I try to fix an already broken item, and other times I end up breaking something that was perfectly fineâ€”but Iâ€™ve always found it fascinating. Over time, I began solving problems in ways that added a personal touch to my work.</p>
<p>I was heavily inspired by countless hours of YouTube videos about woodworking during my teenage years. This led me to start fixing things around the house and eventually buying hand tools for woodworking. I began using reclaimed wood (from pallets, etc.) to make small boxes, shelves, and trays on my balcony.</p>
<p>I find (almost) everything interesting, and when it comes to working with different materials or techniques, I like to think it&rsquo;s not a matter of <em>if</em>, but <em>when</em> the opportunity will arise. If all my hobbies have something in common, it&rsquo;s my love for creating, problem-solving (sometimes by creating problems and then solving them), and expressing myself through my creations. So my combined interest for making and fashion it was inevitable that I would attempt creating something fashion-oriented.</p>
<p>First I tried learning knitting, and I actually succeeded, but after setting a goal that was difficult for me to achieve, I got discouraged and ended up not finishing anything. After that I started experimenting with sewing after someone showed me a cool way to upcycle two pairs of pants by combining them into one pair of flared pants. I sewed them by hand and was thrilled with the result. Immediately after that, I started working on a leather wallet. I actually had designed the perfect wallet (for me) more than a year earlier because I was never satisfied with the wallets that existed already. I kept putting it off but with my first success it gave me the confidence to attempt that too.  I fell in love with leatherwork and was so proud of the outcome that I couldnâ€™t stop talking about it and showed it to everyone I met.</p>
<p>After a while I got myself a sewing machine and I continued upcycling clothes and even began making garments from scratch. I especially enjoyed making bags. Other people liked what I was creating and began requesting custom pieces. However, since I didnâ€™t have a &ldquo;brand&rdquo; for my work, I was hesitant to sell it. Even though I was extremely proud of what I was making, I felt that my work lacked a maker&rsquo;s mark. While I was still learning my craft, balancing a part-time job, and battling procrastination, I struggled to come up with something I was happy with. As a result, these orders kept getting pushed back, and to this day, I still havenâ€™t caught up.</p>
<p>After quitting my job to return to university, it became clear that I desperately needed a name for everything I was creating, as well as a platform to showcase my work. Thatâ€™s why I started working on this website and my Instagram account. Because I donâ€™t want to disappoint anyone further, Iâ€™m not currently accepting commissions or orders until Iâ€™ve caught up with what I already owe.</p>
<h1 id="about-pateda">about pateda <a href="#about-pateda" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>pateda (Ï€Î±Ï„Î­Î½Ï„Î±) was created as a maker mark, so i can put my signature on the stuff i make. Currently focused on garments and fashion-related accessories(bags, wallets ect)</p>
